# [PaperReader](https://nlp-summarization.herokuapp.com/)
CSSE490-NLP Webapp; leverages existing models to make paper-reading easier

It is often the case that when an NLP student/researcher/enthusiast is embarking on learning about a given topic, they will try to find many papers and get a broad perspective of 
the best ideas surrounding the topic. But with the average length of the main text for most publications reaching 8-10 pages, it can be time-consuming to go through an entire 
paper, or even a waste of time if the paperâ€™s key claims are poorly founded. To address this, we propose a web app that takes a link to the pdf of the desired paper and provides a 
few-sentence summary of the key claims and results.
